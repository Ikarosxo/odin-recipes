            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken fingers (also known as chicken goujons, chicken strips, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets or chicken fillets) are chicken meat prepared from the pectoralis minor muscles of the animal. These strips of white meat are located on either side of the breastbone, under the breast meat (pectoralis major). They may also be made with similarly shaped pieces cut from chicken meat, usually the breast, or sometimes just pulverized chicken flesh.</p>
            <p>Chicken fingers are prepared by coating chicken meat in a breading mixture and then deep frying them, in a manner similar to the preparation of schnitzel.They are a very popular snack or main course due to their convenience and have become a staple across the United States.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                <li>8 chicken tenders (about 1 lb.)</li>
                <li>chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat basket with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl. In another bowl, stir together panko and oil until loose and crumbly.</li>
                <li>Dip each chicken tender into egg, allowing excess to drip off. Dip chicken in panko mixture to coat completely. Working in batches if needed, arrange chicken in an even layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
                <li>Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with parsley and serve with honey-mustard sauce.</li>
